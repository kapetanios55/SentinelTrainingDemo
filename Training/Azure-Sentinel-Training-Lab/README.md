## Introduction
These labs help you get ramped up with Microsoft Sentinel and provide hands-on practical experience for product features, capabilities, and scenarios. 

The lab deploys a Microsoft Sentinel workspace and ingests pre-recorded data to simulate scenarios that showcase various Microsoft Sentinel features. You should expect very little or no cost at all due to the size of the data (~10 MB), and the fact that Microsoft Sentinel offers a 30-day free trial on new workspaces.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the lab, ensure the following requirements are met:

1. **Microsoft Sentinel workspace onboarded to Microsoft Defender XDR** — The Log Analytics workspace must be connected to the [unified security operations platform (Defender XDR)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/microsoft-sentinel-defender-portal). This is required for the custom detection rules to deploy correctly via the Microsoft Graph Security API.
2. **Primary workspace** — The workspace used for this lab must be set as the **primary workspace** in Microsoft Defender XDR. Custom detection rules target the primary workspace by default.
3. **Owner or Contributor role** on the target resource group (needed to create resources and assign RBAC roles during deployment).
4. **For the best experience**, enable [Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/data-lake) on your workspace. This allows long-term, low-cost retention of security data and enables advanced hunting over extended time ranges.

### Custom Detection Rules (optional)

The lab can automatically deploy **custom detection rules** to Microsoft 365 Defender via the Microsoft Graph Security API. This requires a **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)** with the `CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All` Microsoft Graph application permission, created **before** deploying the template.

#### 1. Create the User-Assigned Managed Identity

```powershell
# Create the UAMI (adjust resource group and name as needed)
az identity create `
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> `
  --name SentinelDetectionRulesIdentity
```

#### 2. Grant the Microsoft Graph permission

```powershell
# Variables
$miObjectId   = (az identity show --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name SentinelDetectionRulesIdentity --query principalId -o tsv)
$graphAppId   = "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"   # Microsoft Graph
$appRoleId    = "e0fd9c8d-a12e-4cc9-9827-20c8c3cd6fb8"   # CustomDetection.ReadWrite.All

# Get the Microsoft Graph service principal
$graphSpId = (az ad sp show --id $graphAppId --query id -o tsv)

# Assign the app role to the managed identity
az rest --method POST `
  --uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/$graphSpId/appRoleAssignedTo" `
  --headers "Content-Type=application/json" `
  --body "{\"principalId\":\"$miObjectId\",\"resourceId\":\"$graphSpId\",\"appRoleId\":\"$appRoleId\"}"
```

#### 3. Deploy the template

Pass the UAMI's **full resource ID** as the `detectionRulesIdentityResourceId` parameter when deploying:

```
/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/SentinelDetectionRulesIdentity
```

> **Note:** If you skip this parameter, detection rules will not be deployed, but the rest of the lab (workspace, ingestion, alert rules, workbook, etc.) will work normally.

## Log ingestion (modern API)

The training lab includes a script that uses the Azure Monitor Logs Ingestion API to ingest **custom tables only** (tables ending with `_CL`). Built-in tables are not ingested by this API and should be populated via their native data connectors instead.

- Script: [Artifacts/Scripts/IngestCSV-LogsIngestionApi.ps1](Artifacts/Scripts/IngestCSV.ps1)
- Telemetry folders:
	- Custom: [Artifacts/Telemetry/Custom](Artifacts/Telemetry/Custom)
	- Built-in: [Artifacts/Telemetry/BuiltIn](Artifacts/Telemetry/BuiltIn)
- DCR templates output: [Artifacts/DCRTemplates](Artifacts/DCRTemplates)

This script:
- Scans the custom telemetry folder for CSV files ending in `_CL.csv`.
- Optionally scans the built-in telemetry folder when a built-in DCR immutable ID is provided.
- Generates a DCR template per custom table using the CSV schema.
- Optionally deploys the DCE/DCR resources and ingests the data.

See the script header for parameters and usage.
